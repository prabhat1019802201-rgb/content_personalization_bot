Customer context:
- name: {{ name }}
- preferred_language: {{ preferred_language }}
- city: {{ city }}
- segment: {{ segment }}
- primary_channel: {{ primary_channel }}

Internal behavioral notes (for your reasoning only – do NOT mention directly):
- {{ recent_events }}

Product context:
- product_name: {{ product_name }}
- product_category: {{ product_category }}
- benefits: {{ benefits }}
- disclaimers: {{ disclaimers }}

Task:
Generate 3 distinct message variants (A, B, C) for the given primary channel.

Rules:
- For SMS: keep body <= 250 characters.
- For Email: keep body <= 120 words.
- Use a clear call to action (e.g., "Apply now", "View details in the app").
- Prefer lifecycle-based hooks such as "as a new customer", "we miss you", rather than exposing internal app usage logs.
- DO NOT mention internal behavioral notes explicitly (no counts of logins, declined transactions, etc.).
- DO NOT use phrases like "we noticed your recent app activity" or "with 3 app logins".

Output:
- Return 3 JSON objects, one per line.
- Each line: {"variant_tag": "...", "subject": "...", "body": "...", "disclaimers": [...]}
- Use variant_tag "A" for first, "B" for second, "C" for third.
